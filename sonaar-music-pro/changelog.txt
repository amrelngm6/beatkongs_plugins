V.5.0 - 2024-01-22
----------------------------------------------
- New! Our latest update introduces authentic soundwave and waveform displays for your audio, moving away from the fake ('synthetic') waveform. The previous "Dynamic Waveform" option, which relied on Wavesurfer.js, has been phased out due to its impact on website performance and plugin size. We've optimized the waveform rendering by generating compact but very slick peaks, ensuring that both your audio and its visual representation load with exceptional speed. This improvement eliminates the need for Wavesurfer.js, streamlining the overall user experience. we've introduced an efficient server-side peak generation for audio tracks, with each peak file being a mere 4KB in size. This feature enhances the audio visualization while maintaining a minimal footprint. However, we understand the importance of flexibility, so we've included an option to opt-out of peak generation. Users preferring the previous version's placeholder soundwave can easily continue using it. Additionally, soundwaves are now dynamically generated upon the initial play of each track by a user. For bulk processing, users can generate peaks for all their tracks conveniently through the WP-Admin panel by navigating to MP3 Player > Tools > WAVEFORM & PEAKS GENERATION
